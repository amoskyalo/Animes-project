# Introduction
Hello there developer. Thank you for taking your time to pass by my project.

## About this project
This is a simple Animes website. After learning about external APIs and fetch method in JavaScript, I decided to test my understanding by building this simple Animes website. I used external API from [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/). Check the live demo [here](https://animeshome.netlify.app/)

So you might not be familliar with fetch method, and you are wondering what the heck is fetch. Fetch() is a JavaScript method used to request data from a server. If you want to read about fetch, you can check out this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) that I used to learn about fetch.

Apart from implementing the fetch method, I implemented some other client-side functionalities such as:
  - Search - this enables users to search for any anime that they want
  - Sort - enables users to sort animes data in order (A-Z) or according to animes gernes.
  - Viewing all animes - this website first loads part of the data, so they will only be viewing few animes at first. User can click "view all" button to view all animes.
  - Dark theme - enables users to switch between dark and light mode by clicking mode-toogler button
  - Responsiveness - This website is responsive to all devices. You can read about responsiveness [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp#:~:text=Responsive%20web%20design%20is%20about,different%20screen%20sizes%20and%20viewports.)
