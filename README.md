# Introduction
Hello there developer. Thank you for taking your time to pass by my project.

## About this project
This is a simple Animes website. After learning about external APIs and fetch method in JavaScript, I decided to test my understanding by building this simple Animes website. I used external API from [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/). 
So you might not be familliar with fetch method, and you are wondering what the heck is fetch. Fetch() is a JavaScript method used to request data from a server. If you want to read about fetch, you can check out this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) that I used to learn about fetch.
